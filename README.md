## 🔎 About this project:

In the famous TV series Star Trek, the starship Enterprise is able to travel faster than light by warping space-time. In this project, we 'warp' the underlying mesh of a discretised PDE problem to win some computational time. The node of the mesh is moved to the ideal position guided by a GNN, which is supposed to be faster than numerical solvers.


The latest test status:

## 🛠️ Installation

### The easy way:

Just navigate to **project root** folder, open terminaland execute the `install/install.sh` shell script:

``` shell
sh ./install/install.sh
```

This will install [firedrake](https://www.firedrakeproject.org/download.html) and [movement](https://github.com/pyroteus/movement) under `install` folder.


### The hard way (in case the easy way did not goes well or you want to challenge yourself):

1. The mesh generation relies on firedrake, which is a python package. To install firedrake, please follow the instructions on [firedrakeproject.org](https://www.firedrakeproject.org/download.html).

2. The movement of the mesh is implemented by `pyroteus/movement`, install it in the firedrake venv. To install, run `pip install -e .` in the `pyroteus/movement` directory. Here is a link to that repo: [pyroteus/movement](https://github.com/pyroteus/movement).

3. Use the venv provided by firedrake to install the dependencies of this project. The venv is located at `~/firedrakevenv/bin/activate`. To activate the venv, run `source ~/firedrakevenv/bin/activate`. Then run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the dependencies.

4. Run `pip install -e .` in the root directory of this project to install the package.


## 💿 Dataset generation

In case you do not wish to generate the dataset by yourself, here is a pre-generated dataset on google drive: [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1suY-WyECV_-UlWds8tR1gMlD7oxDOlqx?usp=sharing). The naming convention of the file is 'z=<0,1>_n_dist={number_of_distribution_used}_max_dist={maximum_distribution_used}_<{number_of_grid_in_x_direction}_{number_of_grid_in_y_direction}>_n={number_of_samples}_{data_set_type}'

if `n_dist = None`, then the number of gaussian distribution used will be randomly choosed from 1 to `max_dist`, otherwise, `n_dist` will be used to generate a fixed number of gaussian distribution version dataset.

the {data_set_type} will be either 'smpl' or 'cmplx', indicating whether the dataset is isotropic or anisotropic.

after download, you should put the downloaded folder `helmholtz` under `data/dataset` folder.

### Generate the dataset by yourself

```{shell}
python script/make_dataset.sh
```
This command will make datasets of sizes from 15 to 35, both isotropic and anisotropic datasets. The datasets will be saved in `data/dataset` folder.

User can modify the variables
```
n_dist_start=1
n_dist_end=10
n_grid_start=15
n_grid_end=35
```

defined in `script/make_dataset.sh` to generate datasets of different sizes.

The number of samples in the dataset can be changed by modifying the variable `n_sample` in `script/build_helmholtz_dataset`.

## 🚀 Train the model

A training notebook is provided: `script/train_warpmesh.ipynb`. Further training details can be found in the notebook.

Here is also a link to pretrained models: [link] (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1P_JMpU1qmLdmbGTz8fL5VO-lEBoP3_2n?usp=sharing)

## 📊 Evaluate the model

There are a set of visulisation scipypt under `script/` folder. The script can be used to evaluate the model performance.

## 📖 Documentation
The documentation is generated by sphinx. To build the documentation,under the `docs` folder.
